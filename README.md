# SharpTorch

This is a Neural Network tool for C# (currently testing in Unity) currently mostly for study purpose

The main neural network logic is stored in NeuralNetwork.cs

### NeuralNetwork.cs

currently it support forward/backward process of dense layer, Convolution layer, pooling, common activation functions include

* Sigmoid
* Tanh
* ReLU
* LeakyReLU
* Softmax

loss functions include

* MSE
* MAE
* Categorical Cross Entropy
